Hi! my name is Jose I am a theoretical physicist. I received a B.Sc in Physics (2016) and a M.Sc. in Physics (2019) from
Federico Santa María Technical University in Valparaíso, Chile. In 2023 I moved
to Spain (1 year), where I worked as research scientist at the University of Valencia and IFIC. In 2025 will start the PhD Physics
programme at the University Andres Bello in Chile

Currently, I am working in the field of modified or alternative gravitational theories like metric-affine theories
using Palatini's formalism or purely affine models of gravity, like Polynomial Affine Gravity. Exploring classical
aspects in the field of cosmology, black-holes and bosons stars.

Additionally, I am interested in the use of deep learning techniques, specifically the use of neural networks or PINNs (Physics 
Informed Neural Network) to solve numerically partial differential equations within the context of metric-affine
or purely affine models of gravity.

You can find a complete list of my work (updated) in the [Publications and talks](https://joseipg1.github.io/publications/) section and

## Current research projects

These are the my current research projects:

**Project 1: Polynomial affine gravity coupled with a scalar field and non-vanishing torsion fields**. In this project we explore the space of solution of coupling a scalar field in the Polynomial Affine Gravity model with nontrivial torsion fields. The introduction of a non-vanishing torsion field, induces an affine Klein-Gordon field equation which can not be obtained without a torsion field. The space of solution is studied for different types of potential terms.

**Projec 2: Applications of PINNs to BBH orbits**, the basic idea is to train an artificial neural network with the waveform data coming from a binary black-hole system and to recover the geodesic curve of the system. This will be done for different configurations of the problem. The first
step was done by working with Schwarzschild black-hole. The second step is currently being developed by introducing an angular momentum (spin) to 
the binary black-hole system.
 
## News


### December - 2024

- The paper **A polynomial affine model of gravity: after ten years** is done, you can check the pre-print in [Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.21122)

### November - 2024

- The paper **A polynomial affine model of gravity: after ten years** is almost done
- I started a youtube channel where I will be uploading a weekly-videos talking about science, physics and topics related to my research field, please subscribed to my channel!. Currently there are two videos.
- I was accepted at the school **Gravitational Waves in Astrophysics: From Theory to Observations** at the University of Chile, from 18-22 (November).
- Our paper **Cosmological solutions in polynomial affine gravity with torsion** was accepted and published at EPJC.

### July - 2024

- 07 - 2024: I made public the repository containing the work on how to use neural networks the recover the trajectories from a Binary Black Hole system using the gravitational waveform. The first case was done using the language Julia, and I am currently working on developing a version in Python.

### June - 2024

- 06 - 2024: I created a new repository on my github account, named **iGW_BBH** which stands for inverse Gravitational Waves from a Binary Black-Hole system. The idea is to train a neural network with the waveform of the BBH to recover the geodesic curve. This is a privet repository, if you want to known more, please feel free to contact me.

- 06 - 2024: I've added the advanced lectures notes from professor Jorge Zanelli on first order formalism gravity. These notes are from the Graviticulas school at PUC, Chile.

- 06 - 2024: I upload new material on how to couple a scalar field to the Polynomial Affine Gravity in four dimensions, and also, include the details on how to derive the field equations, and the field equations under the symmetries of the cosmological principle. See my research notes.

- 06 - 2024: I've upload a new neural network project to my github page. This is the [link](https://github.com/JoseiPG1/Neural_Networks_Projects/tree/main) to the section, please feel free to study the new and the old project and provide me with feedback. Also, you can find the link in the research notes section, in the new section **Machine learning, Artificial neural networks and PINNs (Physics Informed Neural Networks)**

- 06 - 2024: I give a talk at I-COOP Workshop on Compact Objects, Valencia Spain, named **Polynomial Affine Gravity coupled with a Scalar field and Torsion Fields**, the basic idea was to give a brief introduction to the affine model of gravity, talk about its cosmological solution and how to coupled a scalar field without the necessity of a metric tensor. There were two main question that need to be addressed urgently: the invariance under diffeomorphisms and the equivalence principle.

- 06 - 2024: New version of **Cosmological Solutions in Polynomial Affine Gravity with Torsion** which can be found in this [link](). The pre-print was sent to EPJC.
