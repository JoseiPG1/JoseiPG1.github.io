Hi! my name is Jose I am a theoretical physicist. I received a B.Sc in Physics (2016) and a M.Sc. in Physics (2019) from
Federico Santa María Technical University in Valparaíso, Chile. In 2023 I moved
to Spain, where I am currently a PhD(c). at the University of Valencia.

Currently, I am working in the field of modified or alternative gravitational theories like metric-affine theories
using Palatini's formalism or purely affine models of gravity, like Polynomial Affine Gravity. Exploring classical
aspects in the field of cosmology, black-holes and bosons stars.

Additionally, I am interested in the use of deep learning techniques, specifically the use of neural networks or PINNs (Physics 
Informed Neural Network) to solve numerically partial differential equations within the context of metric-affine
or purely affine models of gravity.

You can find a complete list of my work (updated) in the [Publications and talks](https://joseipg1.github.io/publications/) section.

## Current research projects

**Generalization of Eddington and BI model of gravity**, I've notice that in the work of BI model of gravity they consider
the most general linear combination of the combination of the metric tensor and the Maxwell tensor. In the work [Determinantal Born-Infeld Coupling of Gravity and Electromagnetism](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.09978.pdf), they considered three fundamental fields, the metric tensor $g_{\mu\nu}$, the Ricci $\mathcal R_{\mu\nu}$ tensor and the Maxwell tensor $\mathcal F_{\mu\nu}$. My proposal is to formulate the most general action considering all possible linear combination of those fundamental fields and studied the solution with spherical symmetry.

**Purely affine Born-Infeld gravity**, I am currently studying a purely affine formulation of the Born-Infeld model of gravity, whose action
is written as the sum of the Ricci tensor and the Maxwell tensor.

**Scalar field effects coupled with nontrivial torsion fields in Polynomial Affine Gravity**, this project we explore the space of solution of coupling a scalar field in the Polynomial Affine Gravity model with nontrivial torsion fields. The introduction of a non-vanishing torsion field, induces an affine Klein-Gordon field equation which can not be obtained without a torsion field. The space of solution is studied for different types of potential terms.

**Spherical and static solutions to Polynomial Affine Gravity**, in this project we explore the space of solutions to the alternative gravitational
model Polynomial Affine Gravity in the torsion-free sector, whose fundamental field is the affine connection. We provide an ansatz for the
symmetric part of the connection compatible with the desires symmetries. 

## Research projects completed [2/2]

**Cosmological solutions with torsion effects in Polynomial Affine Gravity**, in this project we solve the field equations of the Polynomial
Affine Gravity with the torsion field turned on. The ansatz for the symmetric and anti-symmetric part of the affine connection, it is compatible with the symmetries of the cosmological principle. The field equation are solved exactly and we provide a physical interpretation of the solutions.

**Inflationary scenarios in an effective polynomial affine model of gravity**, in this project we explore the method to coupled a scalar field to the
Polynomial Affine Gravity model without the use of a metric tensor, and the potential term re-scale the volume form. Then we find analytical and numerical solutions to the field equations (in the torsion-free limit) with and without the effects of the scalar field subject to the most well known potential terms: power law and Starobinsky.
