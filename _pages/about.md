Hi! my name is Jose I am a theoretical physicist. I received a B.Sc in Physics (2016) and a M.Sc. in Physics (2019) from
Federico Santa María Technical University in Valparaíso, Chile. In 2023 I moved
to Spain, where I am currently a PhD(c). at the University of Valencia.

Currently, I am working in the field of modified or alternative gravitational theories like metric-affine theories
using Palatini's formalism or purely affine models of gravity, like Polynomial Affine Gravity. Exploring classical
aspects in the field of cosmology, black-holes and bosons stars.

Additionally, I am interested in the use of deep learning techniques, specifically the use of neural networks or PINNs (Physics 
Informed Neural Network) to solve numerically partial differential equations within the context of metric-affine
or purely affine models of gravity.

You can find a complete list of my work (updated) in the [Publications and talks](https://joseipg1.github.io/publications/) section.

## Current research projects

**Born-Infeld gravity**, I am currently studying the Born-Infeld gravity as a solution on how to coupled matter field to Eddington 
affine model of gravity.

**Spherical and static solutions to Polynomial Affine Gravity**, in this project we explore the space of solutions to the alternative gravitational
model Polynomial Affine Gravity in the torsion-free sector, whose fundamental field is the affine connection. We provide an ansatz for the
symmetric part of the connection compatible with the desires symmetries. 

**Cosmological solutions with torsion effects in Polynomial Affine Gravity**, in this project we solve the field equations of the Polynomial
Affine Gravity with the torsion field turned on. The ansatz for the symmetric and anti-symmetric part of the affine connection, it is compatible with the symmetries of the cosmological principle. The field equation are solved exactly and we provide a physical interpretation of the solutions.
