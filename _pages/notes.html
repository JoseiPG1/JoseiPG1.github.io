In order to build up the action, first we decomposed the affine connection $\Gamma$ into its irreducible fields
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
    \label{affine_connection}
    \hat{\Gamma}_{\alpha}{}^{\beta}{}_{\gamma} & = \hat{\Gamma}_{(\alpha}{}^{\beta}{}_{\gamma)} +  \hat{\Gamma}_{[\alpha}{}^{\beta}{}_{\gamma]},  \\
    & = \Gamma_{\alpha}{}^{\beta}{}_{\gamma} + \mathcal{B}_{\alpha}{}^{\beta}{}_{\gamma} + \delta^{\beta}_{[\gamma}\mathcal{A}{\alpha]},
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
the first term $\Gamma$ correspond to the symmetric part of the affine connection, whereas the last to terms are coming from its
anti-symmetric part, the former $\mathcal{B}$ is the traceless part of the torsion and the latter $\mahtcal{A}$ is the vectorial
part of the torsion tensor.

In order to preserve the invariance under diffeomorphism the symmetric part of the connection must go to the action
indirectly through the covariant derivative $\nabla^\Gamma$.
