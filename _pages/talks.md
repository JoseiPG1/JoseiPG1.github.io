# Differential Geometry
---
Differential geometry is the natural language used to describe gravitational interactions in space time. It is crucial
to have an excellent understanding of the fundamental objects coming from differential geometry which are used
to formulate General Relativity and alternative/modify gravitational models. In this notes I am covering all the basics
concepts and fundamental principles of differential geometry used in General Relativity.
1. Manifolds and fundamental objects.
2. Covariant derivative.
3. [Lie derivative](/files/Lie_derivative.pdf)
4. Bonus! Lie derivative of a connection.

# General Relativity
---
Einsteinâ€™s theory of General Relativity (GR) is currently the most successful theory to describe gravitational interactions, exhibiting excellent agreement between theoretical predictions and observational data in a variety of scenarios, from laboratory and solar system scales, to the orbital motions of binary pulsars, cosmology and even gravitational waves from colliding compact objects and the shadows of supermassive black holes. On this notes, I am covering
the fundamental ideas of his formulation of general relativity and beyond GR.

# Cosmology

2. The FRLW dynamics.
3. Cosmological inflation.
4. Perturbation theory. 

# Polynomial Affine Gravity
---

The Polynomial Affine Gravity it is an alternative gravitational model whose fundamental field is the affine connection $\Gamma$, instead
of the metric tensor. Therefore, the manifold $\mathcal{M}$ is endowed solely by an affine structure $\mathcal{M}\left(\Gamma\right)$
defining the notion of parallelism. In this notes, I am covering its formulation to find  its field equations, analytical solutions and its
physical implications.

# Determinantal gravity
---

These are my personal notes on the development of Born-Infeld type of determinantal gravity whose functional is a generalization of Eddington and Einstein's idea of an affine model of gravity, defined by the square root of the determinant of the Ricci tensor. This will be the main core of my PhD thesis.

# Machine learning, Artificial neural networks and PINNs (Physics Informed Neural Networks)

Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are a type of universal function approximators that can embed the knowledge of any physical laws that govern a given data-set in the learning process, and can be described by partial differential equations (PDEs) or ordinary differential equations (ODEs).
