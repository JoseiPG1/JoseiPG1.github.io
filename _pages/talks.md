Einsteinâ€™s theory of General Relativity (GR) is currently the most successful theory to describe gravitational interactions, exhibiting excellent agreement between theoretical predictions and observational data in a variety of scenarios, from laboratory and solar system scales, to the orbital motions of binary pulsars, cosmology and even gravitational waves from colliding compact objects and the shadows of supermassive black holes.

The Polynomial Affine Gravity it is an alternative gravitational model whose fundamental field is the affine connection $\Gamma$, instead
of the metric tensor. Therefore, the manifold $\mathcal{M}$ is endowed solely by an affine structure $\mathcal{M}\left(\Gamma\right)$
defining the notion of parallelism.
