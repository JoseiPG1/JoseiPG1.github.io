# General Relativity
---
Einsteinâ€™s theory of General Relativity (GR) is currently the most successful theory to describe gravitational interactions, exhibiting excellent agreement between theoretical predictions and observational data in a variety of scenarios, from laboratory and solar system scales, to the orbital motions of binary pulsars, cosmology and even gravitational waves from colliding compact objects and the shadows of supermassive black holes. On this notes, I am covering
the fundamental ideas of his formulation of general relativity and beyond GR.

# Polynomial Affine Gravity
---

The Polynomial Affine Gravity it is an alternative gravitational model whose fundamental field is the affine connection $\Gamma$, instead
of the metric tensor. Therefore, the manifold $\mathcal{M}$ is endowed solely by an affine structure $\mathcal{M}\left(\Gamma\right)$
defining the notion of parallelism. In this notes, I am covering its formulation to find  its field equations, analytical solutions and its
physical implications.

# PINNs (Physics Informed Neural Networks)

Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are a type of universal function approximators that can embed the knowledge of any physical laws that govern a given data-set in the learning process, and can be described by partial differential equations (PDEs) or ordinary differential equations (ODEs).
