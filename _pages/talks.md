The Polynomial Affine Gravity it is an alternative gravitational model whose fundamental field is the affine connection $\Gamma$, instead
of the metric tensor. Therefore, the manifold $\mathcal{M}$ is endowed solely by an affine structure $\mathcal{M}\left(\Gamma\right)$
defining the notion of parallelism.
